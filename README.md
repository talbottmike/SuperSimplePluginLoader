# SuperSimplePluginLoader
Plug-in sample that loads an assembly that implements a plug-in interface at runtime.

I'm having trouble with downcasting an obj that has been loaded from an F# assembly to the interface that it implements.
This project is an attempt to strip down the concept to a minimum and try to get some input from the community.

Problem solved!
Thanks to @bbqfrito for pointing out where I was going wrong!
